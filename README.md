# Shashin - Interactive Photo Booth

![Shashin Presentation](https://i.imgur.com/Vy7jF78.png)

The project will be an interactive photo booth with a built-in editor (in the style of Japanese “Purikura” booths) which will be fully constructed into a physical booth, with the Raspberry Pi as the core hardware running the software which will be developed. The software will be written in the Python programming language along with the OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) library to achieve the level of interactivity desired. The library will be used mainly to handle facial recognition and image processing to apply filters, effects, and stickers to the image. The project will also utilise the ARM Assembly programming language for one of its modules.

## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to create a photo booth akin to those popular in Japan and many other Asian countries, including Thailand, with a significantly lower price point of production whilst retaining as many functions as possible, if not having more functions than the average photo booth. The project also aims to explore into the capabilities of the Python programming language alongside the OpenCV library and the ARM Assembly programming language in making a fully functional and practical project.

## Justification
The reason this project was chosen is because the project is challenging enough to be considered an adequate group project, whilst being not too technical to be unmanageable. This means that it should be ideal for the limited time that we have to complete the project. Furthermore, the project utilises and explores into a wide scope of topics such as programming in Python and Assembly, Facial recognition and image processing with OpenCV, working with the Raspberry Pi, and constructing a physical encasement for the machine, thus offering a wide variety of opportunities in which many skills can be learned, practiced, and displayed.
